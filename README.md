# 👋 Hello, I'm Alfaz Mahmud Rizve

### **Builder • Automator • Architect**

Welcome to my digital workshop! ⚡  
I am a **RevOps Engineer** & **Full-Stack Automation Architect** specializing in **Headless Systems** and **AI-Driven Workflows**. I bridge the gap between complex engineering and business efficiency, building "self-driving" agencies and high-performance applications.

Currently, I am moving beyond traditional web development to architect **Headless WordPress ecosystems** (Next.js + GraphQL) and **Central Nervous Systems** for businesses using n8n.

## 🚀 The Core Stack

I build with tools that offer speed, scalability, and autonomy.

## 👨‍💻 The Philosophy

> "I don't just write code; I build systems that print time."

I believe that modern engineering isn't about typing syntax—it's about designing architectures that solve expensive business problems on autopilot.
